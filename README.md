# Word Count Application

This is a simple Python application that allows users to count the number of words in a selected text file and calculate the total price based on the number of words. The application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to select the file and interact with the user.

## Features
- **Word Counting:** Counts the number of words in a selected `.txt` file.
- **Price Calculation:** Calculates the total price based on a specified amount per word.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Uses `Tkinter` for file selection and user input.
  
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/suhail451/word-count-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd word-count-project
    ```

3. No external libraries need to be installed, as `Tkinter` is part of Python's standard library.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python word_count.py
    ```

2. A file dialog will open. Select the `.txt` file you want to count words for.

3. The program will display the number of words in the file.

4. You will then be prompted to calculate the total price for the file based on the number of words. Enter the price per word when prompted.

5. The program will display the total amount.

## Example Usage
```bash
python word_count.py
